Ajedrez Para Todos was my first web project, so maybe it contains a lot of mistakes, bugs, and the design, being completely honest, is poor.
Anyway, it was designed during a 7 classes course so I'm really happy with the result. I trust in this project, as soon as I can I will add 
some features like a login, a test for deciding the user's level and give puzzles according to, a better design, and then try to keep all updated.
